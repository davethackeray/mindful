# Text Conversion

## Converting Scanned Pages of Text into Analyzable Text

### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
1. Install the Tesseract OCR library:
   ```bash
   pip install pytesseract
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
   ```

2. Use Tesseract to convert scanned images to text:
   ```python
   import pytesseract
   from PIL import Image

   def convert_image_to_text(image_path):
       image = Image.open(image_path)
       text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
       return text
   ```

3. Save the converted text for analysis:
   ```python
   def save_converted_text(text, output_path):
       with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
           file.write(text)
   ```

## Converting Recorded Audio into Analyzable Text

### Speech-to-Text
1. Install the SpeechRecognition library:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   ```

2. Use the SpeechRecognition library to convert audio to text:
   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr

   def convert_audio_to_text(audio_path):
       recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
       with sr.AudioFile(audio_path) as source:
           audio = recognizer.record(source)
           text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
           return text
   ```

3. Save the converted text for analysis:
   ```python
   def save_converted_text(text, output_path):
       with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
           file.write(text)
   ```

## Analyzing the Converted Text to Determine Insights

### Text Analysis
1. Install the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

2. Use nltk to analyze the text and extract insights:
   ```python
   import nltk
   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
   from nltk.corpus import stopwords
   from collections import Counter

   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')

   def analyze_text(text):
       words = word_tokenize(text)
       words = [word.lower() for word in words if word.isalnum()]
       stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
       filtered_words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]
       word_counts = Counter(filtered_words)
       return word_counts
   ```

3. Save the insights for display in the app:
   ```python
   def save_insights(insights, output_path):
       with open(output_path, 'w') as file:
           for word, count in insights.items():
               file.write(f'{word}: {count}\n')
   ```
